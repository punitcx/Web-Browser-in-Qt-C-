Creation : A chromium Based Web Browser Using Qt5.5.1

This is a simple Chromium based Web Browser made in Qt having extra features such as Automatic Scheduled Shutdown,IP Finder,Advanced Developer tools,Transparent View,Screenshot etc.

To use the browser,just download the linux executive file 'Creation' from build.

More features to be added soon..

[Update 2025]: Currently I'm not working on it since the Qt version used is obsolute now. In the future (and if I work), will mostly replace it completely with newer code(and Chromium :)).
